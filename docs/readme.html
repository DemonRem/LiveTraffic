    <h2>Release Notes</h2>

        <p>The number-link refers to the issue in GitHub with (technical) details.</p>

        <h3>v0.83.20181212</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/44">#44 (still open)</a>
                Fixed a bug in Multiplayer Lib preventing to find a match based
                on Doc8643 aircraft categorization (ie. find something of
                roughly similar size) after no match was found
                directly or via <code>related.txt</code>.<br>
                Added feature to do this Doc8643 match also with matching
                airline livery.<br>
                This fix will mean that with a reasonable number of CSL packages
                installed nearly no plane will need to be rendered with the
                default plane (currently A320).
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/52">#52</a>
                Multiplayer Lib: If <code>VERT_OFFSET</code> is not given in
                <code>xsb_aircraft.txt</code>
                files then it will default to a value between 1.2 and 5.5
                depending on Doc8643 aircraft categorization to avoid planes
                sliding on their belly.
            <li>Settings / Labels: Added a new option <i>Any a/c id</i>, which display
                the first non-empty field from <i>flight number, call sign,
                registration, transponder hex code.</i> Good as the one option
                to id an aircraft.<br>
                Note: No config migration implemented, your label configuration
                <i>will</i> shift due to this new entry, please revisit Settings / Labels.
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/54">#54</a>
                Fixed flight phase "Rotate": Aircrafts taking off should now
                in most cases rotate before take off and initially
                climb with pitch up.<br>
                Might also positively influence occurences of too steep take offs,
                but that was not initially targeted with this fix.
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/55">#55</a>
                Once an aircraft reaches an invalid position (like climbed too
                high with no more live tracking data available) it is now removed
                immediately. Reduces number of <code>CalcPPos: Ignoring invalid pos</code>
                debug messages in the log dramatically.
            <li>
                Various ongoing enhancements to <code>related.txt</code>, especially in
                the area of business jets and GA.
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/49">#49</a>
                Settings / Advanced: Cleanup, moved debug options to bottom,
                added option for logging raw network data to <code>LTRawFD.log</code>.
            <li>
                Minor changes and enhancement to debug output and formatting
                into <code>Log.txt</code>.
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3>v0.82.20181208</h3>

        <P>This version does not solve any issue completely but lays the
        foundation to do so with the next version.</P>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/38">#38 (still open)</a>
                Reorganized Resources directory, <b>now also includes <code>FlightModels.prf</code></b>,
                <code>Doc8643.txt</code> regenerated from scratch, current as of November 2018,
                <code>related.txt</code> reworked in large parts (smaller planes yet to do).
                All comes completely with the LT package.
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/44">#44 (still open)</a>
                Identify, log, accept a/c master data without ICAO type code,
                but will still be rendered as A320.
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/42">#42 (still open)</a>
                Started to change how LT looks for CSL directories. Will
                become a config option. Location will now default to
                <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL</code> <b>only</b>,
                but additional places can be added.<br>
                At the moment adding is
                only possible by adding lines to <code>Output/preferences/LiveTraffic.prf</code>
                (start/stop the new version once so that LT writes the
                first path to the end of the file, edit file only when
                X-Plane is off.)<br>
                My file currently ends like this to also include XSquawkBox resources for testing purposes:<BR>
                <code>
                    [CSLPaths]<br>
                    1|Resources/plugins/LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL<br>
                    1|Resources/plugins/XSquawkBox/Resources/CSL<br>
                </code>
                Paths are relative to X-Plane dir. (Theoretically you could
                specify full paths beginning with / or drive letter...but I
                have not yet tested that.)<br>
                The <code>1</code> in the beginning means 'enabled'.
                Guess what 'disabled' means...<br>
                New tab in the settings window yet to come so that later
                nobody needs to fiddle with the preferences file.
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/52">#52 (still open)</a>
                If not given by <code>xsb_aircraft.txt</code> then <code>VERT_OFFSET</code> now defaults to 3.
                That should be OK for mid-range jets, might be a bit high for GA which might
                appear hovering over ground. A better implementation to come which distinguishes
                five defaults by a/c classification.
        </ul>

        <h3>v0.81.20181202</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/39">#39</a>
                Ease usage of LiveTraffic and XSquawkBox in parallel.
                See considerably updated documentation on

                    10.12 Sierra confirmed by tester.
                    Should work down to 10.9 Mavericks.

        <h3>v0.80.20181130</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>First version offered to selected beta testers
        </ul>

    <h2>Essential Installation</h2>

        <h3>LiveTraffic plugin</h3>

            <P>
                The <code>LiveTraffic</code> plugin folder is to be copied into X-Plane's
                <code>Resources/plugins</code> folder, the same as with other plugins.
            </P>

        <h3>CSL Packages</h3>

            <P>
                You must install CSL packages, otherwise there will be no
                aircraft models to display and LiveTraffic will fail to
                start up.
            </P>

            <P>
                Recommended are the "Bluebell" OBJ8 CSL packages found
                at the <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/37041-bluebell-obj8-csl-packages/">X-Plane.org forums</a>.
                Follow their instructions. Also download and install the
                <code>BB_IVAO_vert_offsets_*</code> files in the downloads as recommended
                for the X-IvAp users. LiveTraffic can handle them, too.
            </P>

            <P>
                Place the CSL packages into
                <code>Resources/plugins/LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL</code>.
            </P>

        <h3>Resulting Directory Structure</h3>

            <P>...under X-Plane's <code>Resources/plugins</code> folder:</P>

            <P>
                <code>LiveTraffic/</code><br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/64/</code><br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/64/mac.xpl</code><br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/64/win.xpl</code><br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL/...</code> (here follow the CSL package folders)<br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/Doc8643.txt</code><br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/FlightModels.prf</code><br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/lights.png</code><br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/related.txt</code><br>
