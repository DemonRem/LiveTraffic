        <h3>v0.84.20181223</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/61">#61</a>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/43">#43</a>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/58">#58</a>:
                Better handling of mixed channels. Please run with all channels
                enabled. A/c will at any point in time be fed by one channel
                only, but switching to another is possible if (a) the original
                channel stopped feeding and (b) the new position is in a
                reasonable direction to prevent 180 degree turns.<br>
                As channels aren't time-synched LT needs to make up for the
                reported time difference with unusual slow/fast plane movements.<br>
                A channel switch will be document with a DEBUG-level <code>Log.txt</code>
                entry like <code>DEBUG AA73C3 (SWA1730): SWITCHED CHANNEL from
                'ADSB Exchange Live Online' to 'OpenSky Live Online'</code>.
            <li>FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/48">#48</a>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/57">#57</a>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/58">#58</a>:
                Flight data cleansing introduced, which tries to remove
                ill-looking positions from the position queue.
                This shall lead to a lot less 180 degree turns and other
                weird movements. It will not remove all weird behaviour, though.<br>
                A position removal will be document with a DEBUG-level <code>Log.txt</code>
                entry like <code>DEBUG A25CDC (SKW4148): Removed an invalid position</code>.
                Currently, positional debug information is outuput
                around such an event to ease analysis.
            <li>ADDED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/37">#37 (still open)</a>:
                A/c info wnd displays origin/dest airport info as reported
                by ADS-B-Exchange. No interpretation...if wrong refer to ADSBEx.
            <li>FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/64">#64</a>:
                Fixed using correct altitude value from OpenSky stream,
                specifically: geo altitude instead of barometric altitude.
                Should lead to OpenSky a/c better hit runway threshold.
            <li>FIXED: Enhancements to take-off prediction. Should more often and
                more smoothly see rotate phase right before take off.
            <li>FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/56">#56</a>
                reading <code>[CSLPaths]</code> in <code>LiveTraffic.prf</code>
                containing spaces. Tested/fixed full path usage on Mac.
            <li>ADDED Config file entries for <code>DEFAULT_AC_TYPE A320</code> and
                <code>DEFAULT_CAR_TYPE ZZZC</code> to <code>LiveTraffic.prf</code>
                to specify ICAO types to use when (a) no a/c type could be
                determined and (b) for cars.<br>
                (Start/stop LiveTraffic once for the entries to appear.
                Edit config file only with X-Plane off.)
            <li>ADDED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/51">#51</a>
                identification of ground vehicles in flight data and display of them
                using the type configured with <code>DEFAULT_CAR_TYPE</code> in
                <code>LiveTraffic.prf</code>. Requires such a type as a
                CSL model. Tested with <a href="http://csl.x-air.ru/info/item/150?lang_id=43">
                this model</a>.
        </ul>
        

        <h3>v0.83.20181212</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/44">#44 (still open)</a>
                Fixed a bug in Multiplayer Lib preventing to find a match based
                on Doc8643 aircraft categorization (ie. find something of
                roughly similar size) after no match was found
                directly or via <code>related.txt</code>.<br>
                Added feature to do this Doc8643 match also with matching
                airline livery.<br>
                This fix will mean that with a reasonable number of CSL packages
                installed nearly no plane will need to be rendered with the
                default plane (currently A320).
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/52">#52</a>
                Multiplayer Lib: If <code>VERT_OFFSET</code> is not given in
                <code>xsb_aircraft.txt</code>
                files then it will default to a value between 1.2 and 5.5
                depending on Doc8643 aircraft categorization to avoid planes
                sliding on their belly.
            <li>Settings / Labels: Added a new option <i>Any a/c id</i>, which display
                the first non-empty field from <i>flight number, call sign,
                registration, transponder hex code.</i> Good as the one option
                to id an aircraft.<br>
                Note: No config migration implemented, your label configuration
                <i>will</i> shift due to this new entry, please revisit Settings / Labels.
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/54">#54</a>
                Fixed flight phase "Rotate": Aircrafts taking off should now
                in most cases rotate before take off and initially
                climb with pitch up.<br>
                Might also positively influence occurences of too steep take offs,
                but that was not initially targeted with this fix.
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/55">#55</a>
                Once an aircraft reaches an invalid position (like climbed too
                high with no more live tracking data available) it is now removed
                immediately. Reduces number of <code>CalcPPos: Ignoring invalid pos</code>
                debug messages in the log dramatically.
            <li>
                Various ongoing enhancements to <code>related.txt</code>, especially in
                the area of business jets and GA.
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/49">#49</a>
                Settings / Advanced: Cleanup, moved debug options to bottom,
                added option for logging raw network data to <code>LTRawFD.log</code>.
            <li>
                Minor changes and enhancement to debug output and formatting
                into <code>Log.txt</code>.
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3>v0.82.20181208</h3>

        <P>This version does not solve any issue completely but lays the
        foundation to do so with the next version.</P>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/38">#38 (still open)</a>
                Reorganized Resources directory, <b>now also includes <code>FlightModels.prf</code></b>,
                <code>Doc8643.txt</code> regenerated from scratch, current as of November 2018,
                <code>related.txt</code> reworked in large parts (smaller planes yet to do).
                All comes completely with the LT package.
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/44">#44 (still open)</a>
                Identify, log, accept a/c master data without ICAO type code,
                but will still be rendered as A320.
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/42">#42 (still open)</a>
                Started to change how LT looks for CSL directories. Will
                become a config option. Location will now default to
                <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL</code> <b>only</b>,
                but additional places can be added.<br>
                At the moment adding is
                only possible by adding lines to <code>Output/preferences/LiveTraffic.prf</code>
                (start/stop the new version once so that LT writes the
                first path to the end of the file, edit file only when
                X-Plane is off.)<br>
                My file currently ends like this to also include XSquawkBox resources for testing purposes:<BR>
                <code>
                    [CSLPaths]<br>
                    1|Resources/plugins/LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL<br>
                    1|Resources/plugins/XSquawkBox/Resources/CSL<br>
                </code>
                Paths are relative to X-Plane dir. (Theoretically you could
                specify full paths beginning with / or drive letter...but I
                have not yet tested that.)<br>
                The <code>1</code> in the beginning means 'enabled'.
                Guess what 'disabled' means...<br>
                New tab in the settings window yet to come so that later
                nobody needs to fiddle with the preferences file.
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/52">#52 (still open)</a>
                If not given by <code>xsb_aircraft.txt</code> then <code>VERT_OFFSET</code> now defaults to 3.
                That should be OK for mid-range jets, might be a bit high for GA which might
                appear hovering over ground. A better implementation to come which distinguishes
                five defaults by a/c classification.
        </ul>

        <h3>v0.81.20181202</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/39">#39</a>
                Ease usage of LiveTraffic and XSquawkBox in parallel.
                See considerably updated documentation on

        <h3>v0.80.20181130</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>First version offered to selected beta testers
        </ul>

    <h2>Essential Installation</h2>

        <h3>LiveTraffic plugin</h3>

            <P>
                The <code>LiveTraffic</code> plugin folder is to be copied into X-Plane's
                <code>Resources/plugins</code> folder, the same as with other plugins.
            </P>

        <h3>CSL Packages</h3>

            <P>
                You must install CSL packages, otherwise there will be no
                aircraft models to display and LiveTraffic will fail to
                start up.
            </P>

            <P>
                Recommended are the "Bluebell" OBJ8 CSL packages found
                at the <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/37041-bluebell-obj8-csl-packages/">X-Plane.org forums</a>.
                Follow their instructions. Also download and install the
                <code>BB_IVAO_vert_offsets_*</code> files in the downloads as recommended
                for the X-IvAp users. LiveTraffic can handle them, too.
            </P>

            <P>
                Place the CSL packages into
                <code>Resources/plugins/LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL</code>.
            </P>

        <h3>Resulting Directory Structure</h3>

            <P>...under X-Plane's <code>Resources/plugins</code> folder:</P>

            <P>
                <code>LiveTraffic/</code><br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/64/</code><br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/64/mac.xpl</code><br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/64/win.xpl</code><br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL/...</code> (here follow the CSL package folders)<br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/Doc8643.txt</code><br>
                <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/FlightModels.prf</code><br>
