Taxiing: Really stop (state 'Stopped') when running out of data

TEST DATA
===

Landing:
EDDL 0427/103300, a/c 3C66B2=3.958.450 (A320 DLH6JW) in on final approach, no flight data on the ground, tests artifical touch-down and roll-out
KLGA 0427/150100, a/c A4D65C=10.802.780 lands at 150100, lands, flight data late down the run-way, tests landing detection and touch-down insertion

Take off:
EDDF 0427/103100, a/c 4BA92F=4.958.511 takes off, first position is 500ft AGL

KLGA 0427/150600, a/c   AB2362=11.215.714 takes off
                        A4D65C=10.802.780 lands at 150100, lands, flight data late down the run-way, tests landing detection and touch-down insertion
                        AC7419=11.301.913 lands at 150200, last flight data way down the runway (descend too short for touch-down insertion)
    new
                        AB7617=11.236.887 lands at 150700, seems to have last off-gnd-fd before touch-down and next on-gnd-fd already on the taxi way after turning off the runway. Maybe also just bad merging...
                                                            verify if checking and retaining (un-merged)first on-gnd-pos makes sense
    take-off (?)
                        AB2362=11.215.714
                        ACF0DA=11.333.850 take off at 151800

DOCUMENTATION
===========

Acceleration / Deceleration
----------------------------
Also see Deceleration.psd
Correct point to start decelaration tx
Distance travelled and start/target time are given as per flight data
Distance(area) = distance with const initial speed + distance with decelaration
Distance with decelaration has two parts:
1. The area (rectangular) "under" target speed
2. The area (triangular) between target and initial speed

distance traveled = d
initial speed = vi
target speed = vt
delta speed = ∆v = [vt-vi]          // negative in case of deceleration!
initial time = ti
target time = tt
delta time = ∆t = [tt-ti]
time to start deceleration = tx    <-- looking for this value

    d = vi * [tx-ti]  +  (vt * [tt-tx] + (-∆v) * [tt-tx] / 2)
      = vi * ∆t       -  (-∆v) * [tt-tx] / 2    // decel: from entire rectangle=distance remove the triangle not traveled due to deceleration in the top right corner
      = vi * ∆t       +  ∆v * [tt-tx] / 2       // accel: to the rectangle made up of the initial speed add the triangle traveled faster due to acceleration
⇔  d - vi * ∆t   =  ∆v/2 * tt  -  ∆v/2 * tx
⇔  d - vi * ∆t   -  ∆v/2 * tt  =  -∆v/2 * tx
⇔  -2/∆v * (d - vi * ∆t - ∆v/2 * tt)  =  tx
⇔   2/∆v * (-d + vi * ∆t + ∆v/2 * tt)  =  tx
⇔  tx =  2/∆v * (vi * ∆t + ∆v/2 * tt - d)


LIBRARIES
========
libz / zlib - https://zlib.net/zlib_license.html
    Not actually built individually, comes with OS and/or with libpng.

CURL - https://curl.haxx.se/download.html
    Downloaded latest Source Archive

    * Windows *
    Used Visual Studio to open
        projects\Windows\VC15\lib\libcurl.sln
    Built the solution for targets
        'LIB Debug - DLL Windows SSPI' / 'x64':     build\Win64\VC15\LIB Debug - DLL Windows SSPI\libcurld.lib
        'LIB Release - DLL Windows SSPI' / 'x64'    build\Win64\VC15\LIB Release - DLL Windows SSPI\libcurl.lib

    * Mac OS *
    Build using the script MacOSX-Framework64Lib provided here in the docs folder,
    which creates a 64 Bit static library.

libpng - http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
    Download latest Source code

    * Windows *
    Used Visual Studio to open
        projects\vstudio\vstudio.sln
    Built the projects 'zlib' and 'libpng' for targets
        'Debug Library' / 'x64':    projects\vstudio\x64\Debug Library\libpng64.lib     and zlib.lib
        'Release Library' / 'x64':  projects\vstudio\x64\Release Library\libpng64.lib   and zlib.lib

    * Mac OS *
    Used the provided projects/xcode/libpng.xcodeproj,
    changed from shared to static library.

xplanemp - Created my own fork at https://github.com/TwinFan/libxplanemp, which includes
	- processing of VERT_OFFSET commands in xsb_aircraft.txt
	- changes to reduce warnings
	- a CMakeSettings.json file to help the Visual Studio CMake system
    Had to download GL/glext.h and KHR/khrplatform.h from
    https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Registry/tree/master/api/GL
    https://github.com/KhronosGroup/EGL-Registry/tree/master/api/KHR
	and provided it in central include directories

    * Windows *
    Used Visual Studio to open the folder libxplanemp and used the CMake build system.
    Defined following variables in CMakeSettings.json:
	- XPSDK_DIR to point to the XPLM SDK
	- ADDITIONAL_INCLUDES (new with my fork) to point to additional include directories, in my case to where libpng, GL, KHR includes are located

    Built the targets
        'x64-Debug':    build\x64-Debug\xplanemp.lib
        'x64-Release':  build\x64-Release\xplanemp.lib

    * Mac OS *
    

X-Plane API - Download latest version from https://developer.x-plane.com/sdk/plugin-sdk-downloads/

parson - https://github.com/kgabis/parson
	Download latest version and take over parson.c/.h into the project.
	It is compiled as part of LiveTraffic, not separately.
