<h3>CSL Packages</h3>

    <P>
        You must install CSL packages here, otherwise there will be no
        aircraft models to display and LiveTraffic will fail to
        start up.
    </P>

    <P>
        Recommended are
        <ul>
            <li>
                the "Bluebell" OBJ8 CSL packages found at the
                <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/37041-bluebell-obj8-csl-packages/">X-Plane.org forums</a>.
                Follow their instructions. Also download and install the
                <code>BB_IVAO_vert_offsets_*</code> files in the downloads as recommended
                for the X-IvAp users. LiveTraffic can handle them, too.
            </li>
            <li>
                the <a href="http://csl.x-air.ru/info/item/150?lang_id=43">Follow me car from X-CSL Package</a> as a ground vehicle object.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </P>

    <P>
        Place the CSL packages into
        <code>Resources/plugins/LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL</code>.
